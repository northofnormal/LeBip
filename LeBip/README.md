#  Main goals 
Create a usable, brightly-colored, fun turn-tracking app that features a first-player selection and player persistence, the ability to pause/resume your turn timer

# Stretch goals 
- save gaming groups 
- stat tracking (win/loss record for saved players)
- integrate w/bgg api to save games played? 
- some kind of dashbboard? 
- only allow selection of one color per player per game (two people can't be green)
